How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps by showing the differences in both versions of a file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We are able to know all the histpry of a project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pro in Git we choose the moment whe we to save a change but this it is the cons too otherwise
    in google docs save autonatically the changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is a big advantage because we can save several files thant are involved in a funcionality at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using log we can view the versions of several files and with diff we see the especific differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It make me more confidente to make changes because I can back any time. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try git for my personal projects.
