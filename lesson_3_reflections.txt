When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
I would want to create a remorte repository when I want store one project for a team collaboration.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because is good idea to have the changes of others in my local drive.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I will use forks when I want to make a copy to someones's project at Github, I will use clone to make copys of projects at my local or at Github I can clone directly from the repository of others or making fist a fork an then clone. I will use Branches when I want to experiment in a project.
